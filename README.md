# dobby233liu.github.io

This is no longer my site (see [\# Site Moved](#site-moved)). Instead, it is a placeholder that redirects
to my new site.

## Site moved

Specifically, **a new site has been created** at [`dobby233liu.neocities.org`](https://dobby233liu.neocities.org),
and all content originally on this site, albeit useless and now obselete, has been moved to
`/dobby233liu.github.io-legacy`.
